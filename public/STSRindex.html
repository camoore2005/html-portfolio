<h1>The Best Sports Talk Shows Acording to Chris</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Sports Talk Shows (In My Opinion)</h2>

<hr>

<h3>1. First Take</h3>
<p>Only because my Uncle Shannon left Skip Bayless on FS1. Best decision ever!</p>

<h3>2. NFL Live</h3>
<p>Because its the only thing that I can watch during the NFL offseason. I love football!</p>

<h3>3. Undisputed</h3>
<p>The only reason that this made the list is because I like to see how Keyshawn Johnson and Richard Sherman challenge Skip. Plus, I only watch clips on Youtube.</p>
